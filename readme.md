This project includes a basic web-side **minesweeper game** with 3 levels of difficulty.

![MINE-BOOM.PNG](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/33YANG/mine-sweeper/main/preview/BOOM.PNG)

There is an **automatic minesweeping mode** (each step can be delayed by 1s), and a debug mode in the automatic mode, which allows you to see clearly the operation of each step of the computer.

And a **cyclic automatic minesweeping mode**, where the computer constantly tries to sweep mines to obtain the ratio between the success and failure of mine sweeping.
